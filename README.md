# SAP Upscale Commerce: External Application Samples

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/upscale-commerce-external-application)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/upscale-commerce-external-application)

## External Application Samples for SAP Upscale Commerce

External applications are used to access non-public APIs in Upscale Commerce. 
See [SAP Upscale Commerce User Guide - External Apps](https://help.sap.com/viewer/0160c41e0de84b218d05bc1185213d1d/LATEST/en-US/d3eb8e23c2914424b3c4f73950e9c357.html) on SAP Help Portal.

## Samples

Store Locator: Displays a Google Map with all Fulfillment Stores in your Upscale tenant. It can be configured to display inventory per product per store. This sample allows the Store Locator Custom Component to access store and inventory information. [See Branch](https://github.com/SAP-samples/upscale-commerce-external-application/tree/sample/store-locator-inventory-intermediary).

## Requirements

To embed these components one would need access to an SAP Upscale Commerce tenant and the ability to host Java Springboot applications.
